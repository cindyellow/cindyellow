- 🙋🏻‍♀️ Hey there! I’m @cindyellow (Cindy Shih-Ting Huang), currently finishing up my 4th (and final) year at the University of Toronto as a Data Science specialist.
- 🌟 I’m interested in natural language processing, but more generally in both machine learning and cultural exchange :) Feel free to stop by and say hi in 中文/Español/日本語
- ✏️ I’m currently learning about domain adaptation for machine translation, text-to-image generation, and text-to-speech generation.
